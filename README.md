# CMA-ES Spectrum Unfolding

**Welcome to the CMA-ES Spectrum Unfolding project!** This project provides a robust framework for unfolding particle spectra using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). By leveraging data from Monte-Carlo simulations and experimental measurements, this script can effectively reconstruct the underlying particle energy distribution.

## Overview

This project utilizes CMA-ES to unfold a particle spectrum from an array of deposited energy values obtained through Monte-Carlo simulations. The method is tailored for scenarios where experimental data is captured using instruments like scintillators, providing a way to reconstruct the original energy distribution of particles.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
```bash
pip3 install numpy pandas cma glob re matplotlib.pyplot scipy.interpolate scipy.stats
```


These libraries provide essential functionalities for numerical computations, data handling, optimization, and visualization.

## Installation and Usage

Follow these steps to set up and use the project:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   Clone the repository using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggfauvel/CMA-unfold.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Prepare Your Data:**

- **Response Matrix:** Provide a response matrix calculated from a Monte-Carlo code. This matrix should be shaped as `((N_bin, N_dep))`, where:
  - `N_bin` is the number of different mono-energetic particle energies used in the simulation.
  - `N_dep` is the number of experimental data points (e.g., number of imaging plates or scintillators).

- **Experimental Data:** Supply the experimental data named `Exp_FLUKA` in the shape `((N_dep,))`, representing the deposited energy data points.

3. **Run the Script:**

Execute the main script to perform the spectrum unfolding. The script will process the data, perform optimization using CMA-ES, and visualize the results. Key variable to observe is `sim`, which represents the unfolded spectrum.
```bash
python spectrum_analysis.py
```

This will generate plots comparing experimental and simulated data and display the unfolded spectrum with error bounds.

## Expert Usage

For more advanced users, you can calculate the errors associated with the unfolding method using the provided script:

- **Error Calculation Script:** Use `Calc_errors.py` to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the unfolding results. This script analyzes the uncertainty in the unfolded spectrum, providing a detailed error profile.
